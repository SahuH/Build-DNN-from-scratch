# MNIST_classification_using_feedforward_nn
# Overview
This is an implementation of a fully connected feedforward Neural Network from scratch (multi-layer perceptron) to classify MNIST hand-written digits. This code isn't terribly efficient, but the focus is led on analysing impact of different hyperparameters on the performance of model
# Dependencies
* Python-mnist
* Numpy
* Matplotlib
Install missing depeendencies using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)
# Usage
Download MNIST dataset [here](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/). Put all downloaded files in the same folder as code. Create a folder 'plots' within the same folder. Run the code by typing 'python backprop.py' in terminal
